# What is DoorsOS ðŸšª?

DoorsOS is an x86_64 POSIX-Compliant Limine-based operating system in C. An active effort of making a full OS, with a simple and readable codebase.

## Why make your own OS in [insert year]?

> because I can

Having a good time is my drive for this project + I learn a lot of cool low level stuff alongside that! And, also, I have the ambition to defeat Windows(this os doesn't give you freedom to be honest) and Linux(This is too cocky, like, yea, less manual, when you break the system via an unfogivable error)
